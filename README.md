# Rally Genius
A tool to help AKC Rally competitors and their dogs learn a new course. The Rally competition requires competitors to have their dogs perform certain feats of obedience and agility in response to a series of signs. Competitors often carry around booklets and flash cards with instructions on what each sign requires. Rally Genius replaces these cumbersome methods with a slick app!
